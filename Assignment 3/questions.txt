(1) Assume you are multiplying square matrices of size 256x256 and that a block
    and tile dimension of 32x32 is used. What is the ratio of floating point
    operations to bytes loaded from global memory performed by each of the
    following kernels? Do not ignore store operations. Show your work.

    (a) The kernel implemented in the previous assignment (without shared memory
        tiling)

    OPS = number of new elements x operations per elements 
        = rows x columns x (products + sums)
        = 256 x 256 x (256 + 256)
        = 33554432

    B   = (size of A + size of B) x times each element is read + number of elements written onto c
        = (256 x 256 + 256 x 256) x 256 + 256 x 256
        = 33619968

    OPS/B = 0.998

    (b) The kernel implemented in this assignment (with shared memory tiling)

    OPS = 33488896 (same logic as before)

    B   = (size of A + size of B) x times each element is read + number of elements written onto c
        = (size of A + size of B) x tiles of C that access the tile containing each element + number of elements written onto c
        = (256 x 256 + 256 x 256) x (2 x 256 / 32 - 1) + 256 x 256
        = 2031616

    OPS/B = 16.48387




(2) Assume that a block and tile size of 32x32 is used, and that the program runs
    on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU (the model on the HPC cluster) which has the
    following resource constraints:
        > 2048 max threads/SM
        > 32 max blocks/SM
        > 96KB max shared-memory/SM
        > 64K max registers/SM
    Note that you can extract the resource usage of your kernel, including
    registers/thread and shared-memory/block using the folloing command:
                nvcc -c --ptxas-options="-v" kernel.cu
    Answer the following questions about occupancy for the kernel implemented
    in this assignment. Show your work.

    (a) Is occupancy limited by the max blocks/SM?
    
    No, occupancy is related to the max number of threads possible, it doesn't how they're divided into blocks and how many blocks there are.




    (b) Is occupancy limited by the max shared-memory/SM?

    No, all threads will use the same shared memory so using extra threads will not require extra shared memory.




    (c) Is occupancy limited by the max registers/SM?
    Yes, each thread needs its own registers, so the less there are registers, the less threads we can create.
